Observations:

1. Capomulin and Ramicane showed lower average tumor volume at the end of the study, compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin.  

2. The tumor volume for an individual mouse decreased considerably over the study on Capomulin. It would be worth looking at other mice on other regimens for comparison. 

3. Mean tumor volume is highly correlated with mouse weight (correlation coefficient 84%), this suggests controlling for mouse weight when comparing among drug regimens
